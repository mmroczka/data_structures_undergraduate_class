## Overview

This repo is a conglomeration of 4 of the big programs I wrote during my undergrad at UofM. 

### Program 1 - DNA (Vectors)

A program testing our knowledge on C++ vectors and general algorithmic thinking.

### Program 2 - Who Died? (Multi-Way Trees)

This program is based off a popular video. It explores an inputed royal family tree and accepts a name in the tree as an
argument. It then outputs the number of people that would have to die in the royal family before the inputed name would
be king/queen.

### Program 3 - Highway Entourage to the Premier (Adjacency Matrix & Dijkstra)

This program simulated highways/crossroads and we were given a car at a certain crossroad and asked to find the fastest
path to a specific destination. A playful implmentation of the popular Dijkstra's algorithm using an Adjacency Matrix
instead of a graph.

### Program 4 - In Your Prime

This program deals with prime numbers - more specifically prime sequences. We are given a range of numbers and asked to
identify a prime sequence if one exists using all the numbers in a given range.
